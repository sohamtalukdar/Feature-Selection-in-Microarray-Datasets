# Feature-Selection-in-Microarray-Datasets

*NB: This project is a part of the coursework in BigData. The project is based on Leukemia dataset. However, there will be code for toxicity dataset and the reason for that is we wanted to explore the possibility how our approach might work out with a similar structured dataset.The cluster was provided by University to be used in Databricks for executing the code. *
